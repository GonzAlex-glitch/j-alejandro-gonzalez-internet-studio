	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p> I learned that it would've taken a while for web developers to take into account what
		viewers of some sites may say something about the information they offer. It makes me wonder if
		there was a chance they were run by people spreading misinformation. Luckily, I also learned
		that technology can only advance for better or for worse, it can't ever stay the same, as it which
		can end up integrating things like malware protection or some weird use of AI, I personally prefer
		the former. Because, as interesting as AI is as a way to incorporate certain features that are
		potentially helpful, it seems most are just using it more as a way to replace jobs rather than help
		with them or make "art" that isn't very crafted from an actual person's skill and mindset. </p>
	<h1>Short Paragraph</h1>
	<p>I think conceptually I would really love to build a website promoting me and my friend's multimedia channel.
		It would be a great way of promoting our brand content, along with other things related to our channel
		merchandise, collabs, guest appearances, or links for upcoming events we may attend. It would be like
		Websites like Charri5 or Glitch Productions cause given how big our brand could get, there's a likely
		chance we'd want to hire or get volunteers for what we work on. </p>
