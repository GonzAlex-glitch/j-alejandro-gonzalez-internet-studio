	<h2>Short Bio</h2>

	born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She is a key musician in
	popularizing pop-punk music, as she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop

	<h2>Short Paragraph</h2>
	<p>I really like Avril because I think she's very underated compared to current singers today, she was
	the inspiration for many popular artist today like Taylor Siwft and Olivia Rodrigo. Many say that she was
	the person who paved the wave who modern woman in rock and roll. Plus a lot of songs have messages that
	I think many people can learn and relate to nowadays.</p>
