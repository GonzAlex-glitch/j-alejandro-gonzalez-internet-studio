  	<h2>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles</h2
  <p>
	 It helps give any kind of target demographic the relatable edge that most people can use to gain likeless
	 and reception from the crowd. As the article states most of it all started with mythenic stoires a lot of
	 which have been adated into different books, movies, and shows which trancended them to appeal to a wider audience.
	 Therefore people can get a better understanding what people want in a product and how it can benefit them in certain
	 ways. Many companies do this kind of thing on a regualr basis and it has work very effectively over the years.
	 They can range in different ways like this one Mcdonald's ad that I saw where a dad comes into the drive thru late
	 at night with her sleeping baby in the car but he doesn't stop so he won't wake his kid up. It takes awhile for the
	 the employees to understand what he's doing until they figure out how to comunicate with him to get his order. It's
	 great example of how make up a short and simple but effective story can bring in consumers. Sure sometimes it's not
	 always realistic but that's more reason to how it cna change the way you make something work to make it into an
	 actual reality.
