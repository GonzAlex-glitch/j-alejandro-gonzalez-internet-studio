		When I decided to base my project on the world of one of my favorite shows growing up, I wanted to make sure I created a site with a very bubbly, fun vibe that captures the same feeling as the show. For the main page and overall look for the page, I wanted to do something simple but still unique in its own way, where each page will have 2 characters at the top doing a looping see-saw animation, moving back and forth. I also figured giving the page a border in the middle with the background of the map of Equestria. It felt better than making it the main background cause, when I tried to, I just ended up looking very askew and abstract, which is very distracting. So I went ahead with a border where the map will actually appear as a background, along with placeholders for all the text featured.

		With that in mind, I also wanted to give each border, button, and font a round, circular style that matches the show's iconic logo. Although fonts were quite the hardest thing to handle, mainly due to how, when looking through Google Webfonts Helper fonts, there were were lot of fonts that had the bubbly and round aesthetic I was looking for aside from the already used "Cherry Bomb One". That was when I realized that maybe not everything has to be stylized that way, since some of the credit and sub-credit text from the show used a bit of a more cursive and Times New Roman feel, so I went with Bubblegum Sans. I even gave the paragraphs and headers an outline to contrast with their respective backgrounds.
