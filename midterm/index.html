		Equestria is a 5-star rated popular country well known for its community and culture centered around friendship and magic. Dating all the way back to ancient times, when there were rulers such as Grogar who tried to take over the country with monsters that laid havoc across the land. That was until Gusty the Great came up and stood up against him, leading to the earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi living in a hostile environment from the windigos.

		That was until each of the rulers of each of the tribes would come together, looking for a new land, and after a  brief feud between the 3 and come up with an alliance, creating the Fire of Friendship, thawing out the ice, making peace with each other, and agreeing to share their land as one unified race.

		Over the years, the 2 rulers would go through many different obstacles, encountering sibling rivalry, evil lords, and a few other groups of species that plot to overthrow them and gain their magic.

		Later on, one of the rulers, Celestia, would gain a small pupil who was interested in their history and wanted to see more lies beyond what the 2 sisters had established, but the mentor would rather encourage her student to pursue some that's even more powerful than whatever their enemies would try to gain or already have to their power.

		The student Twilight Sparkle would end up meeting some unique characters in one of the lovely cities in Equestria, known as Ponyville. She had doubts about them at first, for she wasn't interested in making friends at all. But these 5 ponies would welcome her with open arms and gifts, showing off their laughter, loyalty, honesty, kindness, and generosity. Together, these 6 would become the daily heroes who would save the day on a daily basis, show civilians the power of their elements, and eventually lead the next generation of Equestria.
