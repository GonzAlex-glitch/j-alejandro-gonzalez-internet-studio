	ACTIVITIES
</h2>
	<p>
		For being well known for their love and culture around magic, Equestria offers many different kinds of activities themed around their cities and community.
	</p>

	<h3>The Traders Exchange</h3>
	<p>
		Got any cool antiques, old furniture, and bad hand-me-downs that you're really dying to get rid of? Well, come on down to Rainbow Falls, where a huge swap meet is hosted, where creatures from all across the country come and bring in some neat and cool things that are waiting for YOUR trade!! Varying from old clocks to rare animals and completely different-looking badges!

	<h3>Great Galloping Gala</h3>
	<p>
		If you're interested in some fancy, hoity-toity, and high-class events? Then try out the Grand Galloping Gala located in Canterlot to celebrate the city's completion after Equestria was founded! Witness some fine dining, and a garden filled with some of the most exotic avian wildlife. It usually requires a ticket to get in, but all new incoming tourists will be offered a ticket to attend the event, depending on the time guests arrive.
