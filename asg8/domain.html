	<h1>Domain Names</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>FlashStoke</li>
			<li>ColorMeStoke</li>
			<li>GraphicsNArts</li>
		</ul>

	<p>When discussing my Domain ideas with my classmate, I told them I wanted to make up a site about me and my friend's multi media production studio "FlashStoke Productions". I wnat it to be a place where I can showcase up our different projects and upcoming ones as well along with a brief overview of what our company is about. I also want to put up a job listing so those who are interested in what we do can sign up and work with us on our projects.</p>

	<p>I ultimately stuck down with the first idea FlashStoke because aside from it being the name of my collab company, I felt like the other names were more suited for things that revolved around me personally rather than a collaberative effort by me, my friend, and team. Cause ColorMeStoke is my offical username that I use for basically everything online so to have a domain site named after me shoudl focus more on my own work. Then there's GraphicNArts which was already the name of a small Esty shop I host, I prefer just keeping my shop as seperate thing that could maybe be promoted on FlashStoke. I want FlashStoke just be a place where both me and my friend along with my team can promote our talents and show off what we can make therfore FlashStoke just seems like the way to go.</p>
