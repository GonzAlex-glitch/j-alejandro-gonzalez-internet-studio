			<li>ColorMeStoke</li>
			<li>GraphicsNArts</li>
		</ul>

	<p>When discussing my Domain ideas with my classmate, I told them I wanted to make up a site about me and my friend's multimedia production studio, "FlashStoke Productions". I want it to be a place where I can showcase our different projects and upcoming ones as well, along with a brief overview of what our company is about. I also want to put up a job listing so those who are interested in what we do can sign up and work with us on our projects.</p>

	<p>I ultimately stuck with the first idea, FlashStoke, because aside from it being the name of my collab company, I felt like the other names were more suited for things that revolved around me personally rather than a collaborative effort by me, my friend, and team. Cause ColorMeStoke is my official username that I use for basically everything online so to having a domain site named after me should focus more on my own work. Then there's GraphicNArts, which was already the name of a small Etsy shop I host. I prefer just keeping my shop as a separate thing that could maybe be promoted on FlashStoke. I want FlashStoke just be a place where both my friends and along with my team, can promote our talents and show off what we can make; therefore, FlashStoke just seems like the way to go.</p>
