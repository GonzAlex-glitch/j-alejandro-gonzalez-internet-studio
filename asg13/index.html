<h1>DREAM JOBS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the future I'd really love to have a job where I work as a Graphic Designer. It's a position where I'm required to create and make things that can benefit a company in many ways; marketing, social media posts, and appeal to target demographics. It's a pretty underrated field since there are a few different free softwares like Canva that non-graphic designers can understand how to work to design something really simple. Not many people consider how you can get much more appealing and complex results with Creative Cloud.

<p>
  This is for a company headquarted in Dallas that specializes in serves many different auction categories inclsuing Sports, Comics, Fine & Decorative Art, and Jewelry. They're seeking out a well-experienced Graphic Designer to join thier design studio working with production staff, managers, and other fellow designers. They require some one who's advanced at Adobe Creative Cloud which I've been working with for awhile now both for both personal projects and for client works. It also needs someone who can manage a large amount of projects with nearing deadlines, which I had to deal with alot with both college and freelance client work.

<p>
  It thrives on a fast-paced workspace that will involve quick turn around on the process, I'm usually one who doesn't mind quick changes cause I have to work at a part time design shop where we often needed to make last mintue changes for clients. When ever I design something I always try to look and see what I can do to improve it each time which is a talent that they are looking for. They also need someone who's capable of adapting by the multiple looks while capturing the visual characteristics staying with the complied requirements. I'm also someone who's can stay in touch with thier co-workers and clients in terms of communication and keep up with related trends that may involve a client.

<p>
  This job will pay me about $100 to 130k a year and it's a remote full-time job that I can do anytime anywhere I am, which can really benefit me because I do travel a lot so it can be betetr for me to do a work at home job. It will require me to look more into the people who need thier services and show them the most generous things they do through design. It needs a strict and competitive mindset since the entire legal marketing space is know to be very aggressive. I will be responsible for turning briefs into original work for promotional ads, creating marketing emails,  working with Product and Growth Marketing to make page ads that the company will be proud of and improve on thier metric.
