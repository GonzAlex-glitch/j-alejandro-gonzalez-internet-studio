	<div class="white">
	<h1>White Hat</h1>
	<p>
		This will be a site for me and my best friend's small indie multi-media
		company that promotes our social media pages mainly our YouTube channel which
		is our flag ship site. We'll also use it to show off merchandise from our shop
		possibly a shop that's external to the site given what manufacturer we'll sign up
		for. Also we can post up job/volunteer opportunities because given how many fans
		we'll have there's a chance there are some who'd want to work with us.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="red">
	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<p>
		Most of the concept will likely come into fruition until our company becomes
		a lot more popular online. So it's less likely that we'll start off with
		any disapointing results launching the site day one. Which is why we'll post
		a link to the site on the channel about page and promote all over our social
		medias in order to gain more traction for it.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="black">
	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
	<p>
		There will be a chance that not many people will like the site in general,
		it could be for how it looks and how it's not extacly as professional as other
		sites especially ones for indepndent productions. But there's also the case of
		people not liking the idea of a company site in general in fear of how it will
		affect our content supposingly going in a more cooperate direction. But we'll
		let them know for certainty that were not going in a greedy cooperate direction.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="yellow">
	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
	<p>
		On the bright side surely there will be some who will respect the decision of a site
		and see it as a way of expanding our brand and have an all in one place to introduce people
		to our work. Maybe there some people who are intrested with what we do and want to be a part of it.
		Not to mention merchandise as well, sure all of this could be posted on the channel and social
		media accounts but it'd be nice to make up a place where it's all in one place rather than a link
		that can only be obtained in certain platform.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="green">
	<h1>Green Hat</h1>
	<p>
		There's a lot anyone can do with this concept using various color palettes, different fonts
		, and ways of displaying the media. We'll likely stick to overview city aesthetic with the red and
		blue gradient overlay for the backgrounds. As for the fonts I'd really love to use something that's
		bold and loud for the heading text and something with a more pixelated and video game like.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="blue">
	<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
	<p>
		It wil all be about our multi media indie company and the works we've mades, from our small web series
		on YouTube, music videos, and fun little animations. We're also going to have a section displaying
		the merchandise being sold that revolves around the company itself and the series we produce. Then
		finally we'll have a tab for all the open volunteer and job opportunities for all viewers to see
		what we have in store for them.
