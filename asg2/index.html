<h1>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h1>
<p>
  Structured content is merely small chunks of data (articles, recipes, how-tos, etc.) that are relatable to
  each other and can be read by algorithms and converted into pages.
  While semantic HTML is the markup that communicates info in a meaningful relationship to make up a page more
  presentable and recognizable to online viewers
</p>
<h1>How do they work together?</h1>
<p>
  Structured Content basically sets up the blueprint for what info will be listed on the site or page
  when the semantic HTML reads the data listed material given and sets it all up to make up a more appealing,
  well-designed, and easy-to-navigate site.
</p>
<h1>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h1>
<p>
  Because aside from just providing info that people may need in a certain situation, it is also important to make sure
  that it's reliable and true. Cause some info online can be misinterpreted through data, like how Google thought that
  the neuroscientist was what Fitzgerald was looking for when he was really looking for an orthopedic surgeon.
