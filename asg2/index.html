<h1>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h1>
<p>
  Structured content is merely small chunks of data (articles, recipes, how-tos, etc.) that are relatable to
  each other and can be read by algorithms and converted into pages.
  While semantic HTML is the markup that communicates info in a meaningful relationship to make up a page more
  presentable and recognizable to online viewers
</p>
<h1>How do they work together?</h1>
<p>
  Structured Content basically sets up the blueprint for what info will be listed on the site or page
  when the semantic HTML reads the data listed material given and sets it all up to make up a more appealing,
  well-designed, and easy-to-navigate site.
</p>
<h1>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h1>
<p>
  Because aside from just providing info that people may need in a certain situation, it is also important to make sure
  that it's reliable and true. Cause some info online can be misinterpreted through data, like how Google thought that
  the neuroscientist was what Fitzgerald was looking for when he was really looking for an orthopedic surgeon.

<h3>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this
  troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h3>
<p>
  I think the "Show some love" method would probably be the best for me personally because, as someone who's always
  critical of themselves, and also compassionate. I feel like it would only make sense for me to acknowledge my inner
  critic and understand his background since it's my conscience just in another kind of mindset.

<h3>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract
  hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h3>
<p>
  It's when you're prone to getting more reasonable whenever there's nothing you can do but wait. Seeing how I handle deadlines
  would be a great one, cause despite having a system where I can list up deadlines, there are some that I can admittedly
  overlook or misdate them, so it allows me to look more into how I process them.

<h3>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals,
  what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h3>
<p>
  I think I would definitely have network power because I'm only starting to understand coding, so it would make
  sense for me to only understand the structural understanding of the power inherent in standard protocols.
  The power that I don't think I have yet is the Networking Power, because we're not doing anything collaborative
  yet, so I don't have the power to control who's involved in development or not.
