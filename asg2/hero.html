<p>
  Nathan Drake (n√© Morgan) is a character and the protagonist of the Uncharted franchise, most notably in the video game
  series developed by Naughty Dog. He appears in all mainline games: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves,
  Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, the spin-offs Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Uncharted: Fight for Fortune,
  the motion comic prequel series Uncharted: Eye of Indra by DC Comics, and other related media. A charismatic and good-natured
  yet rebellious treasure hunter, the player controls Drake as he journeys across the world to uncover various historical
  mysteries. He is played through voice and motion capture by Nolan North, who influenced Drake's personality by ad-libbing
  segments of the character's dialogue.

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
  Naughty Dog based Drake's appearance on the heroes of pulp magazines, novels, and films. To make him relatable,
  the character was dressed in jeans and a Henley long sleeve, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed,
  and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example,
  he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in
  which he finds himself.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>
  The design and personality of Drake have drawn comparisons to other video game and film characters,
  such as Lara Croft and Indiana Jones. Many reviewers have called Drake a likable and believable character,
  and noted that he is a rare example of a physically attractive character who is not hypermasculine.
