  Nathan Drake (n√© Morgan) is a character and the protagonist of the Uncharted franchise, most notably in the video game
  series developed by Naughty Dog. He appears in all mainline games: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves,
  Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, the spin-offs Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Uncharted: Fight for Fortune,

  segments of the character's dialogue.
