			<h2>WALUIGI</h2>
			<img src="images/waluigi.gif" width="299" height="179">
			<h3>Mushroom Kingdom's Sexiest Man Alive!!</h3>
			<p>
				Fan favorite among many from his respective franchise and often neglected by the big company of Nintendo for his amazing skills and legit cool factor (to the point where he can't get into a certain fighting competition). Waluigi is tough and a bad sports professional because he's acclaimed for showcasing all of his abilities in numerous sports games that can outmatch any foe he sees on the field. As the opposite, more edgy version of the more popular Luigi, he doesn't play nice and is not one to shy away from playing ruthlessly.
